# 🫀 Cardiovascular Health Dashboard (Tableau)

## 📊 Overview
This interactive Tableau dashboard visualizes insights from a cardiovascular disease dataset, focusing on how various health factors—such as **age**, **cholesterol**, **BMI**, and **blood pressure**—relate to the prevalence of **heart disease**. The goal is to uncover patterns that may help in early detection or risk assessment.

## ✅ Key Insights
- **Heart disease prevalence increases with age**, especially in individuals over 50.
- **Higher cholesterol levels** are associated with a higher risk of heart disease.
- **BMI and cholesterol interaction** shows that obese individuals with well above normal cholesterol have the highest heart disease rates.
- **Systolic and diastolic blood pressure** levels are consistently higher in individuals with heart disease.
- Interactive pie charts show heart disease distribution across cholesterol levels.

1. **Heart Disease and Age**  
   - Individuals aged **60–69** show a **67% heart disease** rate.  
   - Heart disease is virtually **nonexistent in individuals under 30**.

2. **Cholesterol & BMI Relationship**  
   - In the **obese category**, **18.21%** of individuals fall under the **"Well Above Normal" cholesterol** group—the highest across all BMI segments.  
   - Still, **63.91%** of obese individuals maintain normal cholesterol levels.

3. **Cholesterol Level vs Heart Disease Prevalence**  
   - **Normal cholesterol**: ~**44%** of individuals have heart disease.  
   - **Above normal**: ~**60%**  
   - **Well above normal**: ~**76%**

4. **Blood Pressure Impact**  
   - **Average systolic BP**:
     - With heart disease: **137.21**
     - Without: **120.43**
   - **Average diastolic BP**:
     - With heart disease: **100.02**
     - Without: **84.25**
